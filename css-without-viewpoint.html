	<p>The Galaxy S21 is the smallest and lightest, followed by the S21+ and the Ultra is the largest and heaviest. The S21 and S21+ have flat displays and they use plastic for the back like the Galaxy S20 FE, while the Ultra is sticks to a glass rear and offers curved display edges, so looks a little more premium.You get a better main 108MP camera, a glass back (instead of plastic), more RAM and a higher-res display. As you'll see in my Galaxy S21 Ultra review, there are some trade-offs. But overall, this is one of the best phones money can buy for those willing to pay a premium and one of the best Android phones overall. However the main difference here is size, with the Galaxy S21's screen measuring 6.2 inches, the Galaxy S21 Plus measuring 6.7 inches and the Galaxy S21 Ultra 6.8 inches. The Ultra also has a wider camera bump to fit in the extra sensors. The display is slightly different on the S21 Ultra too.</p>
